# SongIdeas
Snippets of song ideas and thoughts to turn into tunes.  Why not?

This repo serves as an open view into my personal songwriting process.
ALL FILES IN THIS REPO ARE OPEN TO USE.
Please acknowlege the source of your song idea if you use this.

The license is this: if you use my ideas and don't claim attirbution,
I reserve the right to do it in kind with anything you create as well.
You also waive the right, by using this material without acknowledgement,
to public anonymity.  I also get to call you an asshole.  Otherwise,
knock yourself out.
